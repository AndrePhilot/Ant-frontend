## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Styling**: Bootswatch, Google Fonts, FontAwesome
- **3D Elements**: Spline API
- **Testing**: Jest

## Component Hierarchy

The React component hierarchy is structured as follows:

- **BrowserRouter**: Wraps the entire application to handle routing.
  - **AuthProvider**: Provides the authentication context to manage user state.
    - **App**: The root component that includes all other components and handles the main routing logic.
      - **NavBar**: A navigation bar component, usually visible on all pages.
      - **Home**: The home page of the application.
      - **CompanyList**: Displays a list of companies.
      - **CompanyDetail**: Shows detailed information about a specific company.
      - **JobsList**: Displays a list of job postings.
      - **LoginForm**: A form component for user login.
      - **Signup**: A form component for user registration.
      - **Profile**: Displays the userâ€™s profile information.
        - **Searchbar**: A search bar component used in both CompanyList and JobsList for filtering.
        - **JobCard**: A card component displaying job details.
        - **LoadingOnSubmission**: A loading spinner or message displayed while data is being submitted or fetched.

### Global State Management

The current user state is managed by the `AuthProvider` component, which uses the `AuthContext` to share authentication data throughout the application. The `AuthProvider` initializes the authentication state from localStorage or with default values and uses `useState` to manage state changes, persisting them to localStorage with `useEffect`.
